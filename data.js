    "description": "<p>Agenda:</p> <p>‚Ä¢ 18:30 - Welcome to PyBerlin! // Organisers</p> <p>‚Ä¢ 18:35 - Retro Gamedev: Making your own compiled language for NES in Python // Ivan Nikolaev</p> <p>Talk description:<br/>Mid-80s. The game industry was relaunched with the release of Nintendo Entertainment System, the 8-bit console which defined gaming for the decade to follow.<br/>For its time, it was quite a piece of hardware, featuring the legendary 6502 CPU, 2KiB RAM, and a "GPU" capable of rendering a bunch of sprites on a 256x240 pixels TV screen.<br/>How do you ever make a game with that?! Back in time, it was a raw assembly and thinking by hex numbers.</p> <p>In this talk, Ivan will show you how the NES worked and how to develop games for it. But to keep your sanity in place, there'll be almost no coding in assembly.</p> <p>Instead, you will learn how to create your own programming language, write a compiler for it in Python and make the game development for NES fun!</p> <p>Ivan will show how to define and parse the language's grammar, translate the high-level constructs into low-level instructions, compile them into NES-compatible machine code and build the final game executable which goes into the ROM.</p> <p>Press "start" to continue!</p> <p>Speaker's bio:<br/>Ivan became a programmer, driven by his childhood dream of making video games. During a long journey through software development, he made his bones in the wasteland of system, web and desktop applications. Ivan's dream came true three years ago, when he joined Wargaming and became a part of the awesome team behind the legendary World of Tanks game. Ivan is currently developing the gameplay logic for it.</p> <p>‚Ä¢ 19:15 - Short break</p> <p>‚Ä¢ 19:20 - TBA // TBA</p> <p>‚Ä¢ 20:00 - A slice of Python? // Naomi Ceder</p> <p>Talk description:<br/>In Python, slices are a powerful way to manipulate lists and some other sequence types. But what are a slices really? And how do they do their magic? We'll spend 30 minutes live coding simple experiments to see what a slice is, how they work, and even some a slice's cooler tricks. Anyone who knows what a slice is will come away with a deeper understanding of this Python feature.</p> <p>Speaker's bio:<br/>Naomi Ceder earned a Ph.D in Classics several decades ago, but switched from ancient human languages to computer languages sometime in the last century. Since 2001, she has been learning, teaching, writing about, and using Python. Naomi is the immediate past chair the Python Software Foundation board of directors. She also speaks internationally about the Python community, and on inclusion and diversity in technology in general. By day she leads a team of Python programmers for Dick Blick Art Materials, and in her spare time she enjoys sketching, knitting, and deep philosophical conversations with her dog.</p> <p>‚Ä¢ 20:40 - Closing session // Organisers</p> <p>Link to this event will be provided by organisers closer to the event.</p> ",

It is a participant-driven and agendaless unconference. Our overall theme and focus is OKRs. You as a participant decide what you want to talk about, explore, share or discuss about OKRs. Participants contribute with their sessions and again participants choose which sessions to visit.</p> <p>Register through Eventbrite (free) to save your spot: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.de/e/okr-open-space-tickets-149676702045" class="linkified">https://www.eventbrite.de/e/okr-open-space-tickets-149676702045</a></p> <p>We are looking forward to connecting, sharing and learning with you!</p> <p>Natalija &amp; Cansel</p> ",
